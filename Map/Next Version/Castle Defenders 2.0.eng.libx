72:Don't forget about Rescue Squad bonus - you can use it right now! Just place road plan in the special rescue tile located in the wall corner where this message sends you!
73:Tip #2: Don't waste gold! You have not so much gold, and a lot of weak soldiers equipped too early will be useless later.
74:Tip #3: Arrange defence positions within team. The best way is to defend corners (two flank and one middle entrances per player).
75:Tip #4: No need to send much soldiers to defend flanks until 13th wave. Only some enemy soldiers could go there, so one small squad will be enough to kill them.
76:Tip #5: Check wave names - sometimes they can help you to choose troops for defence.
77:Tip #6: From now you have to defend flanks.
78:Tip #7: To use Rescue Squad bonus, you should have too less soldiers and recruits. Usage limits: %d soldiers and %d recruits.
79:Tip #9: To use Lategame Bonuses, place winefield plan one tile down from special objects near the allied Barracks.
80:Tip #8: Lost all your serfs? Don't worry! Place Field plans within the Castle to respawn them.
